# airbnb-listings
Airbnb, established in 2008, Airbnb has transformed the hospitality industry by providing travelers with personalized and affordable lodging options worldwide. Its platform enables property owners to list accommodations ranging from single rooms to entire homes, offering guests various choices beyond traditional hotels. This model has democratized travel accommodations, fostering a global community of hosts and guests.
Despite its innovative approach, Airbnb's built-in pricing tool, known as Smart Pricing, has faced criticism for inefficiencies that can lead to revenue losses for hosts and suboptimal experiences for guests. Smart Pricing utilizes algorithms to adjust listing prices based on factors like demand and location. However, it has been observed that this tool often sets prices below market value, resulting in potential revenue losses of up to 46% for hosts. Additionally, the tool's lack of customization can lead to prices that do not accurately reflect the unique attributes of individual listings, causing dissatisfaction among hosts and guests alike.
Understanding the myriad factors influencing Airbnb listing prices is crucial for hosts and potential guests. For hosts, setting competitive yet profitable prices are essential to maximize occupancy rates and revenue. Guests, on the other hand, benefit from transparent and fair pricing, which enhances their overall experience and trust in the platform. In dynamic markets like New York City, where the real estate landscape is complex and ever-changing, determining these factors becomes increasingly challenging. Factors such as location, amenities, seasonal demand, and local events can all significantly impact pricing. Moreover, external elements like regulatory changes and market saturation add layers of complexity to pricing strategies.
To address these challenges, our project focuses on the following research question: What are the key factors that determine the price of an Airbnb listing, and how accurately can we predict prices using machine learning models? By leveraging supervised machine learning techniques, we aim to identify significant determinants of pricing and develop models capable of providing reliable price predictions. These insights can assist hosts in optimizing their pricing strategies, thereby reducing revenue losses and enhancing the overall Airbnb experience for guests. Accurate price prediction models can also contribute to a more balanced marketplace, where prices reflect true market values, benefiting the broader community.

In summary, this project seeks to bridge the gap between current pricing tools and the nuanced realities of the Airbnb market. By employing advanced analytical methods, we aspire to contribute to a more efficient and equitable platform for all users.
